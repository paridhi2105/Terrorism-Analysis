# Terrorism-Analysis

This app analyses terrorist activities over the World and India for the time period 1970-2018.

I have used the dataset provided by Forsk Coding School and worked under their guidance.

The main code is present in \Code\app.py
The home page of UI consists of two tabs viz. Map Tool and Chart Tool.
Each of these tabs have their own subtabs for representing world data and india data.
For map tool, some dropdowns are provided to update the map according to user requirements.
The chart tool showcases trends in terrorist activities over the years according to different values selected from dropdown.

The \Code\assests folder is required for favicon purpose.

The problem_statement.docx contains the detailed client expectations along with the features required in the app.
